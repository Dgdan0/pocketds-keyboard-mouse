 * you which key had registered. The brief is a good physical keyboard rather
 * than a light show: clearly different when you look at it, never something
 * that draws the eye by itself.
 *
 * Dark keys lift and light keys sink, because a white key has nowhere brighter
 * to go. Both move by the same amount, so the two themes feel alike.
